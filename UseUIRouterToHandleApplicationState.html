<p>Proper routing in your Single Page Application(<em>SPA</em>) is integral to good UX (User Experience).  The applications that developers are building these days have multiple views, sections, and most importantly reusable components for rapid development and consistent delivery.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <h4>Routing</h4>
    <p>Isn't routing typically directly related to the site URL?  Well no, it doesn't have to be, and unfortunately the initial implementation of the Angular Router followed this convention.</p>
    <br>
    <p><code>ngRoute</code> was the first iteration by the Angular team which was eventually removed from the core framework sometime around Angular 1.2.  If you want to use the Angular Router v1, you'll have to download the package exclusively and inject it via <em>"ngRoute"</em>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><code>ngRoute</code> has a straight forward implementation, map the URL to specific JavaScript code that is executed when the URL changes.  All of this to preserve the back button functionality...</p>

<div>
<h4>Issues associated with ngRoute</h4>
<p>The primary issue with the ngRoute implementation is that it ultimately focuses on the URL!  The URL is the dominant force which determines where you are in the application.  This is the reason why you can only have a single <code>ng-view</code> directive on a page at a time.</p>

<p>The handicap here is forcing you to build all of the potentially reusable components into a single view and then using directives such as <code>ng-include</code> as a workaround when you need to nest your views.  Things can get even hairier when you start having <code>ng-hide</code> and <code>ng-show</code> directives everywhere... </p>

<div>
<h4>UI Router to the Rescue</h4>
<p>UI-Router, largely influenced by frameworks such as Durandal.js and Ember.js, pushed the routing experience within Angular to a whole new level.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<h4>States</h4>
<p>States are the driving force in UI-Router.  The <code>$stateProvider</code> is similar to ngRoute, except the state is focused on the <em>location</em> in the application and not the <em>URL</em>.</p>
<p>States can be centrally defined in your application module <code>.config()</code> or a better solution would be to define the states on individual modules.  For more information on clean Angular code, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">Style Guide</a></p>

<div>
<h4>Installation and Configuration</h4>
<p>Installation is fairly straightforward and can be done with either NPM or Bower.  I prefer bower because I use <a href="https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep">wiredep</a> to inject the resources, but you have options :).</p>
<p><code>npm install angular-ui-router</code></p>
<p><code>bower install angular-ui-router --save</code></p>
<p>Don't forget to pick up the DefinitelyTyped TypeScript typings as well:</p>
<p><code>tsd install angular-ui-router --save-dev</code></p>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Configuring States</h4>
<p>Let's dive into the state configuration:</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<pre class="prettyprint">
app.module("main")
    .config(configuration);

/* @ngInject */
function configuration($stateProvider) {
    $stateProvider
        .state("about", {
            url: "/about",
            controller: "app.contact.AboutController",
            controllerAs: "vm",
            templateUrl: "./application/contact/about.html"
            //Rest of your code
        })
        .state("contact", {
            controller: "app.contact.ContactController",
            controllerAs: "vm",
            templateUrl: "./application/contact/contact.html"
            //Rest of your code
        });
</pre>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<p>The <em>State</em> defines the UI with a controller and view.  A state can have a parent/child hierarchy which allows for nesting and multiple views, which leads us to the major features behind UI-Router.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nested Views:  </strong>Allows you to define the state hierarchy with <em>dot notation</em> or the parent parameter.  The power here is SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) which allows you to separate various views to their own controllers.  </li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Named Views: </strong> Allows you to have multiple named views within a view, which point point to different views.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<br>
<div>
<h4>Nested Views</h4>
<p>With the traditional Angular router, <strong>ngRoute</strong>, you're already defeated by being forced to navigate to other views when you want to show related model information.</p>
<p> Sure you can get around this by strategies such as <code>ng-hide</code> <code>ng-show</code>, and <code>ng-include</code> but these are not maintainable solutions.  One controller will have to handle all of the logic or do intricate handoffs...</p>
<p>Here is an example of a parent/child hierarchy:</p>
</div>
<div>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
//Explicitly defining the parent relationship
$stateProvider
  .state("post", {
    //controller, views, etc
    })
  .state("tagList", {
    parent: "post"
    //controller, views, etc
  });

//Using dot notation
 $stateProvider
    .state("post", {
    //controller, views, etc
    })
    .state("post.tagList", {
    //controller, views, etc
    });

    </pre>
</div>
<br>
<div>
   <p>Note that a parent state must <strong>exist</strong>!!  If you specify a child state with dot notation such as <code> "post.tagList"</code>, <em>tagList</em> will never activate unless a <code>post</code> state is defined.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="text-center">

</div>
<br>
<div>
<h4>Multiple Named Views</h4>
<p>Reusable, modular and maintainable code should be your goal when designing modern web applications.  <em>UI-Router</em> enables you to separate your states into multiple named views which you can inject with specific state names.</p>
<p>
For instance, suppose you have a standard view page with a filters bar, tabledata graph, a pie chart and maybe other sub-views such as the header and footer.  The center page may change based on user interaction, do you want to navigate to a whole new view and re-render the navbar and sidebar?  No, you want to reuse those components and the logic behind the scenes.

</div>
<br>
<div>
<p>HTML markup to locate your named views:</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <pre class="prettyprint">

    &lt;div ui-view="filters"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div ui-view="tabledata"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div ui-view="graph"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    </pre>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p>State configuration for your named views:</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        .state('report',{
            views: {
                'filters@': { },
                'tabledata@': { },
                'graph@': { }
    }
  })
    </pre>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p>UI-Router gives us the power to have parallel views that can reference previous states within deeply nested states.</p>
<p>In another post we'll dive deep into how I use <em>UI-Router</em> in the OSS blog application I am building.</p>
