<p>By now you may have heard the news, EcmaScript(ES) 6 2015 is finalized and JavaScript is going to be propelled into future and satisfy the needs of all non-JavaScript developers to easily transition to a dynamic language without Classes.  Well, I'm not here to burst your bubble, but that's not happening.  What <em>IS</em> happening, is that we are getting nothing more than <strong>syntatic sugar over JavaScript prototypal inheritance.</strong></p>
<p>Just to be 100% clear, "class oriented" programming, in the sense that we are not going to be able to instantiate classes like we can in C# or Java.  If you aren't already familiar with the tradional sense of classes and how developers have been butchering JavaScript to re-invent classes, don't worry, we'll cover it shortly.</p>

    <h4>Traditional Classes</h4>
    <p>The way many of us have learned about classes inevitabiliy clouds or judgement and understanding of non-class based language such as JavaScript.  Classes are the blueprint that is used to create objects.  Do not confuse classes and objects, especially in JavaScript, they are nothing alike.</p>
    <p>Once a blueprint for a class has been defined, such as it's methods and properties, it does not change.  Objects are exact and distinct copies of the class.  Objects are instances of classes and the process to creating objects involves class instantiation.  Following?  Good, let's cover one very distinct point with classes and instantiated objects:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Changes to one object instance does not influence other instances.</strong></p>
    <p>Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Overriding are all part of traditional class oriented languages.  Normally these are represented as the 4 pillars:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abstraction</li>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Polymoprhism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These concepts should be familiar, but if they're not, here are some resources to help you brush up:</p>

    <h4>Assuming Classes exist in JavaScript</h4>
    <p>It's not entirely your fault if you were mislead by the <code>new</code> and <code>instanceof</code> keywords, especially if you heard <strong>"JavaScript is getting classes in ES6!"</strong>.</p>
    <p>You can design <em>"classes"</em> in JavaScript through abuse and fragility of the <code>.proptotype</code>.  </p>
